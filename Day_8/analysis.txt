For part 1, we have 1000 JBs, and we find the 1000 pairs that are closest together. The JBs are laid out on an X-Y grid, where X and Y are both max around 100,000

So we calculate the distance for every pair, which is 1000C2, call it 5 million. Which is fine for brute forcing. If I wanted to optimise, I'd segment the search space.

For example, I could split the search area into a 10x10 space, giving me 100 buckets. Now when looking for the nearest match, I can start by looking at grid-squares close to me, before going further afield.

For part 2, we connect pairs until all JBs are in one big circuit. Every time we connect a pair, we merge the circuits.

Note that we find the circuit for a JB by iterating through the entire set of circuits, which is a bit horrible. 2We could give circuits IDs (instead of just storing them in a list, use a dict), and then have a mapping from JBs to circuits.
