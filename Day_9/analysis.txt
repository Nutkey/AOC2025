Part 1 is easy. We have about 500 points in the input set. So we want to maximise the area formed by a selection of 2 points. 500C2 is 2.5 million, so computing that is no problem.

Part 2 is harder. We need to determine, for each candidate rect, if any part of it is outside the boundary path formed by the points. 

Inspection of the data using matplotlib showed that we don't need to worry about S-shaped snake paths which could give us a false failure

Therefore we can assume that if the boundary path has a path segment that termines fully inside (excluding edges) a candidate rect, then the rect is partly outside the boundary.

For example, the rectangle below

XXX
XXX
XXX

could be filled by the complicated path below which has a sub-path end at 1,1. We do NOT worry about this. 
R1  R6 R7 R7
R1 R2 R3 R5
R1 R2 R3 R5
           R4 R4 
           
 The algorithm is therefore
 
 For each candidate rect, check all subpath segments Pn - > Pn+1 - if no subpath crosses an edge, then there is no problem.
