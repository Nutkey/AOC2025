Part 2 consists of a set of incomplete linear equations - incomplete because there are multiple solutions. 

We have this in the matrix form 

E * B  = C

B is the number of times each button is pressed as <buttons> x 1 matrix
C is the Joltage counter requirements  expressed as a <counters> x 1 matrix
E is the <counters> x <buttons> matrix expressing the effect of pressing each button on each joltage level. 

For example, the first row contains <buttons> elements. Each element is 0, or 1. 1 if pressing the button affects the joltage level of the first counter. 
The second row is the same, but now dealing with the second counter.

Initially I thought I could calculate the inverse of E, but it is a singular matrix, which should not have surprised me. 

I then wrote the beginnings of a linear equation solver that was capable of subtracting equations from each other. Then I read a hint about using Z3, and rapidly derived a solution.

The only difficulty is that Z3 does not yield the minimum solution. The fix for that is to find ANY solution, then ask Z3 for a smaller one, repeatedly, until it fails.
